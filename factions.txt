# factions.txt
# List of valid 'NPCFaction' values for use in quest json files. Terms 'AI' and 'NPC' are interchangable.
West, Friendly toward Civilian and West
East, Friendly toward Civilian and East
Raiders, Hostile toward everyone, including other Raiders (unless they are part of the same group)
Mercenaries, Hostile toward everyone except other Mercenaries
Civilian, Friendly toward any faction that is not hostile to them (so by default, West, East, Civilian, Passive and Guards)
Passive, Completely passive, will not even look at other entities.
Guards, Always friendly toward other guards, friendly toward other AI and players as long as they don't raise their weapon
InvincibleGuards, Like guards, but can't be killed.
Shamans, Friendly towards other shamans, won't attack or be attacked by Zombies/Infected and animals. I dont like using Shamans as I like NPC's to be vulnerable to threats, but may be useful in some scenarios.
Observers, Will only look at other entities, but not engage in combat.
InvincibleObservers, Like observers, but can't be killed. Should used for Quest Giver NPC's in the "NPCFaction" json attribute.
Brawlers, Friendly toward Civilian and Brawlers. Very strong melee that can one-shot Infected with fists.
RANDOM, Chooses one of the above factions that are not invincible, observer or passive and don't have special melee abilities.
